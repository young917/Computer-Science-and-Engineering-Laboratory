**TASK2**


Sort number pairs (X,Y):

sort all pairs based on X values and if two pairs' X values are same, then sort it based on Y values.


For sorting, differentiate the order on odd index pairs and even index pairs: 

*odd index* - sorted in ascending order for X values and in descending order for Y values in case of same X values between pairs.

*even index* - sorted in descending order for X values and in ascending order for Y values in case of same X values between pairs.
